# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

## Better Code Hub

I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!

## How to use this Kata for Code Shop

This virtual Code Shop is goingÂ run a bit differently. We'll all check out the same repo, and pull the same branch.
Then the `Driver` will open an editor and share their screen, while the `Navigator` will direct them via Zoom. After time is up,
the `Driver` will commit and push their code, and the `Navigator` will pull down those changes, share their screen and become the `Driver`

- Manuver a terminal into a nice directory
- `git clone` this repo
-  `cd` into `./GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/ruby`
- open up `gilded_rose.rb` in an editor to check out the code
- run `rspec gilded_rose_spec.rb` to run the specs
